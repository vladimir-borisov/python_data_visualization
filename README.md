# Python data visualization tips

Realization of frequent issues which I face in daily work.

All plots here it's a combination of matplotlib + seaborn.
Because it's quaite low level and you can control every part of your graph.

Main ideas of this repo:

1. Show how to create nice graphs in python which will look good in a presentation
2. Cover all possible and common cases with plots in seaborn and matplotlib
   It took me a lot of time to understand what is important and really needed.
